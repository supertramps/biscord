### Like Discord, but with a üêù!

This project is made for an assignment where we got to learn more about WebSockets.
This project was made by [Asaf L√§ckgren](https://github.com/intradastingly), [Sebastian Zazzi](https://github.com/zazzzi) & [Alexander Liljedahl](https://github.com/supertramps)

#### Front End

The front end is written in [react (TypeScript)](https://create-react-app.dev/) with [material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) as design system.
We also used [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to get the correct send-time for messages.

#### Back End

In the back end we've used [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to handle our WebSockets and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the server.

### For developers:

1. Clone the project.
2. You need to install all dependencies from root directory with `npm i`.
3. Run the application from root with `npm start`.
